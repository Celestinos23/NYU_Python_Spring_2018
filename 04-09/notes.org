* Git workflow:

- fork a copy from the base repo to your account
- clone a local copy ~git clone http...~
- edit the files
- ~git add~ any new files
- ~git commit -m "specific message"~
- ~git push origin master~
- send the base repo owner a pull request from your account

* Test Driven Development
- Red: write a test that fails
- Green: write code that makes it pass
- Refactor: clean up your code
